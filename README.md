# De-novo-transcriptome-assembly-and-annotation-of-necator-americanus
This is a modular pipeline of a De novo transcriptome assembly and annotation pipeline specific for nematodes, as well as the results from it for two sequencing runs that were found on NCBI's sequence read archive for the L3 stage of Necator Americanus. It also includes an attempt to create a modular nextflow pipeline of the project but the scripts have errors and are open to modification and improvement, however the pipeline works as for fastqc and trimmomatic only.
