# De-novo-transcriptome-assembly-and-annotation-of-necator-americanus
This is a modular pipeline of a De novo transcriptome assembly and annotation pipeline specific for nematodes for two sequencing runs that were found on NCBI's sequence read archive for the L3 stage of Necator Americanus. It also includes an sh scripts as well as a modular nextflow pipeline of the project. The nextflow pipeline extends all the way to mmseqs only, no diamond sigularity container was found for it and it will have to be done using the ssh scripts
